Hey fellahs, this is just some quick notes on what I got:

-For the sensor settings in settings.json, to change the orientation
 of the sensor, we have to edit the the "yaw", "pitch" and "roll",
 not the x y and z like I originally thought

-changed getVehiclePose to getMultirotorStatus

-added if-else to check if sensor is detecting distance

Here are some sources I have utilized while making this:
 
simGetVehiclePose information
https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/issues/1956

Basic Sensor Information
https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/sensors/

Api Information - contains bit of info on getMultirotorState()
