Hey fellahs, this is just some quick notes on what I got:

-For the sensor settings in settings.json, to change the orientation
 of the sensor, we have to edit the the "yaw", "pitch" and "roll",
 not the x y and z like I originally thought

-if in get slice, simGetVehiclePose does not work in grabbing x, y, and
 z coordinates, there is a getMultirotorState() but I do not know
 what the return is and how to just grab the x, y, and z because 

Here are some sources I have utilized while making this:
 
simGetVehiclePose information
https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/issues/1956

Basic Sensor Information
https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/sensors/

Api Information - contains bit of info on getMultirotorState()
