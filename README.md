# Modeling-Unmanned-Aerial-Swarms-Using-Unreal-Game-Engine-and-AirSim-Simulator
Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University EECS Department Senior Design Project

Not a stand-alone application - Microsoft AirSim necessary to run simulation.

Our vision is to produce a simulation of a swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). A swarm is defined as a multitude of UAV moving and communicating in a unified, cohesive manner. All UAV will routinely communicate its respective position and other behavioral data to the swarm. The swarm will move within a three-dimensional environment to collect data about that environment. Specifically, we want the swarm to gather data about irregular, identified objects, such as the volume and other initial characteristics of a plume of smoke. The swarm will report its data to the team on the ground.
